Welcome to CatsCorner!

This is a space where I will document my learning journey in functional programming using the Cats library. As I continue to learn and grow, I will use this project share my insights with others in the community.

With CatsCorner, I hope to inspire and encourage others to explore the world of functional programming, and to show how Cats can help them unlock the full potential of functional programming in Scala.

A number of excellent books and resources that have helped me to develop my understanding of functional programming and Cats. These resources include:

Functional Programming in Scala by Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason
Scala with Cats by Noel Welsh and Dave Gurnell
Cats documentation and examples on Github

I highly recommend these resources to anyone who is interested in learning more about functional programming and Cats, as they provide excellent insights and practical advice for developers of all levels.

I look forward to sharing my progress with you as I continue to explore the fascinating world of functional programming with Cats!
